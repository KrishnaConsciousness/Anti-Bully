"Hi ! CAAAV Organizing Asian Communities will be operating a relief center out of our office at * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in Chinatown tomorrow ( Wednesday ) and likely continuing for the week. Needs are : people to help pass out fliers , access to a generator , and supplies in general ( food , water , batteries , flashlights ) . Please see below for more info ! And if you can come to our office tomorrow beginning at 10 am , that would be great. : ) from * * * * * * * * * * * , CAAAV ED : Two things of most importance : 1 ) There is no information getting into Chinatown. While the tenants were able to get newspapers mid-day , the news was obviously not up to date. No one is able to make cell phone calls , there is no internet. Some people who can , are able to send texts , but almost everyone I talked to had used up the battery on their phones. They have no idea how long the electricity will be gone for. They have no idea when the trains will work again. There was no one giving out information , and it was clear there was no place to get information. 2 ) There are no services. No one has generators running so there is no backup of anything. There are buildings where there are tenants with no water at all. In the public housing , water was shut off , and there are still a significant number of residents still inside. They 're fine otherwise , but could use some water. This is what we can do : Thanks * * * * * * * and * * * * * * * * * * for letting me know that folks are ready to help out tomorrow. We will need all the help we can get. The most important thing is that we get information out to people. And then we also gather stuff that they may need for the next three-four days. I 've already spoken to the tenants and told them that our office will be open tomorrow for whatever information they can get , and we 'll try to have some things that they would need. CAAAV has a couple hundred bottles of water from the walk-a-thon. We 'll give those out. That 's pretty much all we have. So if you have extra flashlights , batteries , and food , we 'll take it. What we really need is a generator. People want to be able to plug their phones in and the office would be helpful to others if we were connected. Right now we need to make fliers with information to pass out to people , but we wouldn 't be able to make the copies at the office. People will also want to make phone calls and we can open our phone lines if we have electricity. If you have access to an office space where we can print out and make copies of information for folks , please point me in the right direction. I 'll be working on a flyer tonight and will get it translated. Otherwise we 'll go to whatever copy places are open and just suck it up. OR if you can also help make copies and bring them to the office , that would be helpful. I think we can also use people tomorrow to go out and give out the flyers , check in on people in the buildings , and bring water to them if they need it. And people to be cheerleaders and listen to folks. Doesn 't matter the language , bodies are important at this point. Today , they all wanted to talk to me because I represented world outside of Chinatown , so please consider spending some time.
